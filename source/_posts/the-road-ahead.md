On Monday, I will be jumping head first into Hack Reactor, an intensive coding bootcamp.

I made this decision after feeling that my career had reached a bit of a plateau. While I was happy handling the project management side of web development and web projects over the past few years, I always wanted to 'get my hands dirty' by doing more of the actual coding. It was frustrating having to go back to the development agency for what seemed to be minor changes, all because I was worried that I'd break something if I played around with the underlying code.

So, I started trying to learn code. I had a Raspberry Pi, so Python seemed like a good start. I took whatever tutorials and mini-courses I could find: Codecademy, Coursera, Udemy, Code Wars etc. There are so many good (and free) resources around the internet that will get the ball rolling.

But I was craving something more. Something with structure, with goals. Something in a collaborative environment, with other people who had a similar outlook.

Enter Hack Reactor. I knew a tiny bit of JavaScript and managed to get by the little coding test you need to get past the first stage. Easy peasy!

Then the technical interview rolled around. I didn't actually realise that it would be a technical interview. Naively, I just thought it would just be a meet and greet, a formality while taking my money. It wasn't that. At all. And I failed the interview miserably. But my interviewer was really nice and said that I just needed a bit more work.

After some tutoring on the finer (but still basic) points on JavaScript, I retook the interview and passed. Phew!

From there, it's just been a blur, trying to get all the precourse work done, while also trying to identify and really grasp key JavaScript concepts. I'm definitely not there yet, but I think that will be kind of how it will be for the next 3 months: study, get confused, ask questions, make mistakes. Hopefully, there will be the occasional epiphany. :)

For now, Luke out. We'll see what Monday brings... I'm excited though!
