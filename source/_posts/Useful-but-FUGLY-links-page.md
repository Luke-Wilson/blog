During the prep phase before going into Hack Reactor, I made this page to store handy links as my first foray into using jQuery to play around with HTML elements. Here's a screenshot:

While it is admittedly one of the fugliest things I've ever made (I suck at CSS), I find myself using it every day. Whenever I come across a cool link, I add it to this page, and change the functionality as I need it.

The links are broken up into useful categories, and I seem to be able to find what I'm looking for pretty quickly. Right now, whenever I need to add a link, I just copy the code block from one of the other divs, and then change out the link, image and text. There's probably a much easier way to do this, but I haven't got time right now to figure that out. You can <a href="https://github.com/Luke-Wilson/study_homepage">check out the repo here</a>.

"But Luke, you could just use bookmarks!" Yes, voice-inside-my-head guy, you're 100% right, but I still like using this :)

Oh, and day 1 of HR is going swimmingly.
