Ooof! My last blog post was almost 3 years ago. But don't fret, I'm still here, I'm still coding, and I'm still learning.

With that said, I've learned A LOT over the last three years. I've built some apps that I'm really proud of at <a href="https://www.blueriver.com">Blue River</a>, where my current role is Senior Solutions Architect. Most of those projects fall under an NDA, but in future posts I'll share some lessons learned while respecting that agreement.

I'd say the majority of those apps have been built with Vue and, as a result, Vue has overtaken React as my goto JS framework/library. Vue is super powerful and fast, and it's easy for junior devs and non-JavaScripty people to get their head around, which makes it easier for them to help maintain as feature requests roll in. Usually I'll integrate Vuex from the start, as I've found it's better to have it there and not need it, rather than needing it and having to interrupt your flow to set it up (although, it's really not that hard, especially when I think back at getting a Redux store setup in React). I plan on doing a quick write-up as to how I set my Vue projects up.

I've also learnt a lot about API development, having built out a decent number of API methods and REST services over the last few years. I'm always looking to improve performance in these builds, as scalability has become an important part of all my projects, especially those projects for a particular client. All of my professional backend code has been written in CFML which, despite its reputation, is not so bad. I like to keep my NodeJS skills sharp though, so all my side projects have some element of NodeJS.

One of the most rewarding skillsets that I've been able to work on lately is being a mentor. Recently we split all our software engineers and PMs into three agile teams, and I serve as the technical lead, helping come up with the right solution for the client's need. Using Scrum, I lead three other engineers, making sure they have what they need to be productive. This has been a little challenging given the sheer amount of work we have, and some tight deadlines, but I really enjoy sharing my experience and helping get people unstuck. The down side is it that it cuts into my code time, which I still love, but it's worth it to keep the ball rolling on all of our projects.

So, that's it. Just a quick check-in. I am rebuilding lukewilson.net from the ground up (using Vue). This ol' Hexo blog has been good to me, but I feel like it's time for a fresh look and feel. Thanks for stopping by!
